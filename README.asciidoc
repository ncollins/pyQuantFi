PyQuantFi is a simple quantitative finance library written in Python.
It is adapted from code in the book "C++ Design Patterns and Derivatives 
Pricing" by Mark Joshi. Currently it has features covered in the first 6
chapters, including classes for:
- options
- payoffs
- parameters
- random number generators
- statistics gathering

PyQuantFi only requires the Python Standard Library, it does not
use any additional libraries written in C (e.g. NumPy, SciPy). 
This limits its speed when running on CPython but means
it will run on a wider range of Python implementations, including
PyPy, Jython and Google App Engine.
